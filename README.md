A little Late for Halloween but maybe just right for german Karneval - it's a Write up about the Googely Eyes 
- Adafruit Eye bonnet
	- https://www.adafruit.com/product/3356
- Follow their direction on how to install all the stuff 
	- https://learn.adafruit.com/animated-snake-eyes-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/software-installation
- The eyebonnet trick we want to make use of is burried in fbx2.c / the compiled version of it -> itâ€™s scrappping parts of the main screen and is rerouting that to the two displays.
- Because Iâ€™m a lazy fuck I didnâ€™t change their scripts yet (also this allows to switch to their pretty cool but more or less random eye movement)
	- // Todo: I think I could utilise some image detection addon board, a cam like pyCam or just add some python tensorflow lite stuff with Picam (I intend to become moar familiar with it at some point. Btw also this Pun was intended ðŸ¥³
	- If one thinks about cleaning up -> check pi-eyes.sh to not install all the stuff weâ€™re not using and the fbx2.c file
- Alright, so since weâ€™re lazy and weâ€™re using simple Processing, weâ€™re just renaming the python file that would be called normally. In my case thats the â€žeyes.pyâ€œ in boot/Pi_Eyes (if you need to rename eyes.p depends on the type of screens you attached to the board and the selections you chose in the pi-eyes-installation routine. Thereâ€™s also cyclops.py for example)
- So whats happening is that raspberry normally would run eyes.py on boot but since we rename it it wonâ€™t get called (I know, itâ€™s a really ugly hack ðŸ™‚ )
$ cd /boot/Pi_Eyes/  #moving to the Pi_Eyes folder
$ sudo mv eyes.py eyesBAK.py  #renaming the file
$ sudo reboot now  #rebooting to take effect
- Instead we start a processing sketch that renders what ever we want at exactly the locations that fbx2 grabs the graphic information and copies it to the two oleds; check out the Processing sketch to witness my crimes 
- Thatâ€™s all folks
